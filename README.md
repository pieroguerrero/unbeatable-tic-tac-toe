## General Information
- This Tic Tac Toe game can be played agains another human or against the Artifial Intelligence build with the [Minimax algorithm](https://www.educative.io/answers/the-minimax-algorithm).
- The game has funny UI and sound effects.

## Technologies and Techniques used
### Planning and Design:
- The cornestone of this game is the implementation of the **Minimax algorithm**, the one was used to give intelligence to the computer, making it unbeatable.
    > The minimax algorithm is used in Artificial Intelligence to determine an optimal move for a player in a two-player game. It assumes that the other player is playing optimally.
    >
    > There are two types of players: The **Maximizer** and the **Minimizer**.
    >
    > **You are the Maximizer, and your opponent is the Minimizer**. 
    >Your goal at the node representing your move (called the max node) is to maximize the value at that node. Your opponentâ€™s goal at the node representing his/her move (called the min node) is to minimize the value at that node. The minimax algorithm does a depth-first search of the game tree.

    Chek out the example in the video below, where the CIRCLE nodes are the MAX nodes which chooses the maximum valued children node, the SQUARE nodes are the MIN nodes which chooses the minimum valued children:

### Front-end:
- Vanilla Javascript.
- The internal application state is managed 100% with [Clousures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures).
- CSS design with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). 
- The web app is 100% responsive.

### Back-end:
- This web app has no backend for now.

### Testing:
- Manual testing was done with 100% coverage.

V1.0

## Room for Improvement
There are always room for improvement, in this project so far the thinkgs that can be improved are:

- Implement automated Unit Testing.
